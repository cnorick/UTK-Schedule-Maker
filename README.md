# UTK-Schedule-Maker

Every semester, its the same old headache. UT gives you a schedule that you can view online or download as a pdf. But a schedule in that format is just about as useful as a knife with no blade. So every time I get a new schedule, I spend 15 minutes adding each class, one-by-one, as an event to my calendar.

This extension solves that problem! All you have to do is:
1. Install the extension.
2. Go to https://my.utk.edu and choose the schedule you'd like to download.
3. Click the UT Schedule Maker icon that should now appear next to your URL.
4. Get on with your life.
